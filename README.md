## GFG Problem Of The Day

### Small Milestone for me
In June 2022, I created a fun project called CP Contest Calendar extension and published it on the webstore. As of now, it has over 6000 active users. So, if any of you would like to use it, you can also install it from [here](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cp-contest-calendar/nchadgecfkcdikollfdhgobmjoeaiegd).

### Today - 22 February 2024
### Que - Distinct occurrences
The problem can be found at the following link: [Question Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/distinct-occurrences/1)

### My Approach
This is a question of the take-non take type of dynamic programming, which involves breaking a string into multiple strings based on a specific condition. So I also used dynamic programming to solve this problem.
  - I define a recursive function `solve` to compute the number of distinct occurrences of string `t` in string `s` starting from indices `i` and `j`.
  - At each step, we have two choices: 
    1. Not take the current character of `s`.
    2. If the current character of `s` matches the current character of `t`, then we advance both pointers.
  - We memoize the results to avoid redundant computations.

### Time and Auxiliary Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `(O(n x m))`, where `(n)` is the length of string `s` and `(m)` is the length of string `t`.
- **Auxiliary Space Complexity**: `(O(n x m))` due to the memoization table.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int mod = 1e9 + 7;

    int solve(int i, int j, int n, int m, string s, string t, vector<vector<int>>& dp) {
        if (j == m)
            return 1;
        if (i == n)
            return 0;

        if (dp[i][j] != -1)
            return dp[i][j];

        int ntake = solve(i + 1, j, n, m, s, t, dp);
        int take = 0;
        if (s[i] == t[j])
            take = solve(i + 1, j + 1, n, m, s, t, dp);

        return dp[i][j] = (take + ntake) % mod;
    }

    int subsequenceCount(string s, string t) {
        int n = s.size(), m = t.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(m + 1, -1));
        return solve(0, 0, n, m, s, t, dp);
    }
};
```

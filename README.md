## GFG Problem Of The Day

### Today - 15 February 2024
### Que - Count all Possible Path
The problem can be found at the following link: [Question Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/castle-run3644/1)

### My Approach
Check for the existence of an Eulerian cycle in the graph. 
- If every node in the graph has an even degree, it implies the existence of an Eulerian cycle. To determine this, sum the elements in each vector in the input `paths`. 
- If any vector accumulate an odd sum, the function returns `false`, indicating the absence of an Eulerian cycle.

##### Note:
To understand the Euler circuit please [refer to this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xR4sGgwtR2I)

### Time and Auxiliary Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity** : `O(N*M)`, where `N` is the number of vectors in `paths` and `M` is the average number of elements in each vector.
- **Auxiliary Space Complexity** : `O(1)`, as we are not using any extra space except for some variables.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution
{
public:
    Node *flattenBST(Node *root)
    {
        function<pair<Node*, Node*> (Node *, Node *, bool)> dfs = [&](Node * node, Node * prev, bool isLeft) -> pair<Node*, Node*> {
            if(!node)
                return {nullptr, nullptr};
                
            pair<Node *, Node *> left = dfs(node -> left, node, 1);
            pair<Node *, Node *> right = dfs(node -> right, node, 0);
                
            node -> left = left.first;
            node -> right = right.first;
            
            Node * MIN = left.first ? left.first : node;
            Node * MAX = right.second ? right.second : node;
            
            if(isLeft)
                MAX -> right = prev;
            
            node -> left = nullptr;
            return {MIN, MAX};
        };
        
        return dfs(root, nullptr, 0).first;
    }
};

```

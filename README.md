## GFG Problem Of The Day

### Today - 03 March 2024
### Que - Largest Number formed from an Array
The problem can be found at the following link: [Question Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/largest-number-formed-from-an-array1117/1)

### My Approach
- I Defined a custom comparison function func that compares two strings a and b based on their concatenation in different orders (a + b vs. b + a).
- The goal is to arrange the strings in a way that concatenating them results in the largest possible number.
- Use the sort function to sort the array of strings (arr) in descending order based on the custom comparison function func.
- This step ensures that the strings are arranged to form the largest number when concatenated.
- Concatenate the sorted strings to form the final result.
- Return the concatenated string as the output.

### Time and Auxiliary Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(NlogN)`, where N is the number of strings in the array.
- **Auxiliary Space Complexity**: `O(N)`, where N is the number of strings in the array.

### Code (C++)
```cpp
bool func(string& a, string& b)
{
    return a+b > b+a;
}
class Solution{
public:
	string printLargest(int n, vector<string> &arr)
	{
	    sort(arr.begin(), arr.end(), func);
        string out;
        for (auto s : arr)
            out+=s;
        return out;
	}
};
```
